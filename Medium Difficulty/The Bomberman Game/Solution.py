"""
Since detonations take place only at odd times, if n (the number of seconds) is even,
the grid is composed only of O.
At n == 1, no detonations take place, so the grid is the starting grid (initial_grid).
At n == 3, the first detonation happens (grid_after_first_detonation).
After this second, we note that there is a recurrent pattern that repeat itself every 4 seconds:
- at n == 5, 9, 13, ... (i.e. when n % 4 == 1), the grid is equal to grid_after_second_detonation
- at n == 7, 11, 15, ... (i.e when n % 4 == 3), the grid is equal to grid_after_third_detonation
